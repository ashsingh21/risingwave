RisingWave is a distributed SQL database for stream processing. It is designed to reduce the complexity and cost of building real-time applications. RisingWave consumes streaming data, performs incremental computations when new data comes in, and updates results dynamically. As a database system, RisingWave maintains results inside its own storage so that users can access data efficiently.

RisingWave ingests data from sources like Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar, Amazon Kinesis, Redpanda, and materialized CDC sources.

Data in RisingWave can be output to external targets such as message brokers, data warehouses, and data lakes for storage or additional processing.

*RisingWave has achieved production-readiness and has been effectively deployed in dozens of companies across a diverse range of industries, including entertainment, fintech, social media, and manufacturing.*

## Notes on telemetry

RisingWave collects anonymous usage statistics to better understand how the community is using RisingWave. The sole intention of this exercise is to help improve the product. These statistics are related to system resource usage, OS versions and system uptime. RisingWave doesn't have access to any user data or metadata running on RisingWave clusters including source and sink connection parameters, sources, sinks, materialized views, and tables. Users have an option to opt out of this collection using a system parameter. Please refer to the RisingWave user documentation for more details.
